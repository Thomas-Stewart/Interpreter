# Interpreter-Project
This project was part of the CSCI 230 class. The objective was to write a program that could read and perform actions according to our own simple programming language. In this case, it was the BIOLA language. This interpreter allows the user to input code and it will sort through the lexical analyzer and name every piece of code as a certain token. The program will run based on if the next token is a relational operator, conditional statement, string literal, etc. I used vectors and maps to implement an expression evaluation class that will do arithmetic based on the proper order of operations and variable values.

This repository includes the source files and 4 tests that can be imported once it is compiled. There is also a PDF with a description of BIOLA Syntax.
